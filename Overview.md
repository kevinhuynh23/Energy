# Overview
__________________________

__Energy__ illustrates the companies provided in each state and what type of "green" energy is produced by these companies. The map allows users to understand what company caters to their state along with what type of energy (Photovoltaic, Concentrated Solar Power, Onshore Wind, Offshore Wind, Biopower Solid, Biopower Gaseous, etc.) and the amount of energy. Tha goal of the overall Energy page is to allow users to better understand what electrcity companies they are utlizing and what types of energy they are actually using, whether the energy falls under "green" energy. Hopefully, the understanding gained from looking at the map and testing out different areas, the user will have stronger control over their energy usage and where their energy comes from. 

# Description
__________________________

The __Energy Map__ page allows users to test out different combinations of states, companies, energy levels, and energy type to display a visual of where the energy is coming from and who it's coming from. Also, the map gives the users the ability to hover specific states to see the different type of energy each state uses and the power output of each energy type. 

The __Energy Table__ page allows users to see all the data in a table format for those who wants to see all the energy types and power output all laid out in front of them at the same time. The table can be motified based on the state/region provided to only show energy types and output from those specific areas.
